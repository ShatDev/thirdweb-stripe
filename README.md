## Thirdweb Stripe

This project demonstrates an example flow for setting up subscription based payments for web3 apps using thirdweb authentication and stripe.

## Setup

To run the project, first clone this repository, and then run one of the following commands to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Next, you need to create a `.env.local` file and add the `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` variable to it with the private key of the wallet you want to use as the admin wallet to generate and verify payloads. Your file should use something like the following:

```.env
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

Additionally, you should create your own [Stripe](https://stripe.com) test project and get your `Stripe Secret Key` from the Stripe dashboard. From here, you can paste the secret key into the `.env` file as well:

```.env
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
```

Finally, you can run the project with one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Now, you can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to visit the client side page where you can connect a wallet, authenticate, and subscribe.
